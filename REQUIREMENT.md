# Create a small application in React:

## 1) This application will consist of three pages (Login - homepage - detailpage)
    1.a) Use this library for create any components https://ant.design/ (Ex. Form for validation, tables, button etx.)
    1.b) The navigation between pages must be through the React Router library (https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start)
    1.c) All components of this application must be made with a functional components.
    1.D) It would be perfect to use redux for all action.


## 2) The login page redirect, after validation, to the homepage.


## 3) In the Homepage create a table:
    3.a) The table must have this column (nameProject,create_by, create_data, nValues actions)
    3.b) Create a data example for this table, the nValues value in this data is an array of dict (data, value)
    3.c) Inside the actions cell insert 2 icons we correspond of 2 actions (delete and viewDetail)
    3.d) The delete action deletes the array element
    3.e) The viewDetail action redirect from a detailpage with a nValues


## 4) In this page we see a simple graph with the previously passed nValues.
    4.a) for the graph use this library https://recharts.org/en-US/
    4.b) we must be able to return to the previous page
